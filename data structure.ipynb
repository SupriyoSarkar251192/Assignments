    "1. Why might you choose a deque from the collections module to implement a queue instead of using a regular Python list?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: There are a few reasons why you might want to use a deque instead of a list in Python:\n",
    "        1. Deques are more efficient for appending and popping elements from both ends.\n",
    "        2. Deques are thread-safe, meaning that they can be used safely in multithreaded applications.\n",
    "        3. Deques are memory efficient, meaning that they use less memory than lists."

    "2. Can you explain a real-world scenario where using a stack would be a more practical choice than a list for data storage and retrieval?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: Call stack in a computer program: A computer program keeps track of the functions that are currently being called in a stack. This allows the program to return to the function that called it when the current function finishes executing."

    "3. What is the primary advantage of using sets in Python, and in what type of problem-solving scenarios are they most useful?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: The primary advantage of using sets in Python is that they allow for fast membership testing. This is because sets are implemented using a hash table, which is a data structure that is optimized for looking up elements.\n",
    "Another advantage of sets is that they are unordered. This means that you do not need to worry about the order of the elements in the set, which can be helpful for certain tasks such as removing duplicates from a list.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some specific problem-solving scenarios where sets are most useful in Python:\n",
    "1. Removing duplicates from a list.\n",
    "2. Finding the intersection, union, or difference of two sets.\n",
    "3. Checking for membership in a set.\n",

    "4. When might you choose to use an array instead of a list for storing numerical data in Python? What benefits do arrays offer in this context?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: When you need to store a large amount of data: Arrays are more memory-efficient than lists, so they are a good choice for storing large amounts of numerical data.\n",
    "When you need to access the data in a specific order: Arrays store data in a contiguous block of memory, which makes it faster to access the data in a specific order.\n",
    "When you need to perform arithmetic operations on the data: Arrays can directly handle arithmetic operations, while lists cannot. This can make it easier and faster to perform calculations on the data."

    "5. In Python, what's the primary difference between dictionaries and lists, and how does this difference impact their use cases in programming?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: \n",
    "1. A list is an ordered collection of items, whereas a dictionary is an unordered data collection in a key: value pair.\n",
    "2. Elements from the list can be accessed using the index, while the elements of the dictionary can be accessed using keys.\n",
    "3. The list allows duplicate items, while the dictionary does not allow any duplicate keys.\n",
    "4. A list can store any data type. In contrast, keys in the dictionary can be of any immutable data type, and values can be of any data type.\n",
    "5. Lists perform faster for ordered operations like sorting, while dictionaries perform faster for lookup operations."
