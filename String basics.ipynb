    "        1. Format: A hypothesis is a predictive statement, while a research question is a question.\n",

    "        3. Knowledge required: A hypothesis requires a significant amount of knowledge, while a research question can be based on minimal knowledge.\n",
    "        4. Outcomes: A research question can have a broad range of outcomes, while a hypothesis has a narrow range.\n",
    "        5. Variables: A hypothesis includes variables, while a research question does not.\n",

    "\n",
    "Ans: Problem solving and critical thinking refers to the ability to use knowledge, facts, and data to effectively solve problems.  This doesnâ€™t mean to have an immediate answer, it means one have to be able to think on his/her feet, assess problems and find solutions. The ability to develop a well thought out solution within a reasonable time frame, however, is a skill that employers value greatly."

    "5. How does the concept of supply and demand influence the pricing of goods and services in a market economy?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: In a competitive market, supply and demand interact to determine prices. The law of supply and demand states that prices are determined by the relationship between supply and demand.\n",
    "Supply and demand are the willingness of consumers and producers to buy and sell. The price of a product is determined by the equilibrium price, which is the price at which demand and supply meet. The size of a price change is determined by the amount of the shift and the elasticity of demand or supply.\n",
    "The law of supply and demand centers on prices that change when either the supply of goods and services or the demand for them changes. Normally, when supply increases and demand doesn't, prices go down. If supply remains unchanged while demand increases, prices rise.\n"
